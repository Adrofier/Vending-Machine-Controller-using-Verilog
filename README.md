# Vending-Machine-Controller-using-Verilog
Vending Machine Controller with basic testbench just to check the functioning of the module. This is just a hobby project and is not intended to replicate the working of a real vending machine and hence not covering all the possible cases.

This module is made using verilog and is complied under Icarus Verilog 0.9.7 Compiler.
The testbench does not cover the the all the working modes of this controller but is only intended to to check whether the module is performing as desired or not.
